# Loss Landscape Matters: Training Certifiably Robust Models with Favorable Loss Landscape

This repository is the official implementation of "Loss Landscape Matters: Training Certifiably Robust Models with Favorable Loss Landscape".

<!----
> ðŸ“‹Optional: include a graphic explaining your approach/main result, bibtex entry, link to demos, blog posts and tutorials
---->

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

<!----
> ðŸ“‹Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...
---->

## Training (and Evaluation)

To train and evaluate the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py --config config/cifar10.json
python train.py --config config/mnist.json
```

<!----
> ðŸ“‹Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.
---->


## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [OUR model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17MsumEnGQvpMQaXMXRZK4xK8mpnO0oRz/view?usp=sharing) trained on MNIST.
- [OUR model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MuXNJ63_HwzKtBMrRlvrLGIzD3FhH-Ov/view?usp=sharing) trained on CIFAR-10.


<!----
> ðŸ“‹Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models.
---->

## Evaluation of pretrained models

After downloading the pretrained models to the directory ./pretrained, you are ready to evaluate them.
To evaluate the pretrained model, run:

```eval
python evaluation_mnist.py --test_pth pretrained/mnist_save.pth
python evaluation_cifar10.py --test_pth pretrained/cifar10_save.pth
```

<!----
> ðŸ“‹Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance against $\ell_\infty$-perturbation :
